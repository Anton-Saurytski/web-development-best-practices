## Aptimus Best Coding Practices README ##

### Please help out and contribute! ###
I'm only one person, and I don't know everything (very close, but not quite).

If you see a mistake, know of something better, or just want to help out at all in any way possible, please feel free to contribute!

If you're not a git master and just want to pass something along, feel free to email me at <a href="mailto:ryan.chapel@apollogrp.edu?subject=Aptimus%20Best%20Practices%20Suggestions">ryan.chapel@apollogrp.edu</a>
