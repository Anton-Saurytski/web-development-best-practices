					<h2><a name="generic">Generic Best Practices</a></h2>
					<ul>
						<li>If you're editing a file someone else started or is working on, use the style / formatting syntax that is used throughout the rest of the document. One caveat here is if you're doing a pretty big overhaul of the file, and the code in there really isn't formatted properly. If that's the case, then have at it and make it better. :)</li>
						<li>Write your code as clearly as possible. Don't abbreviate variables / classes / ids so much that no one knows what they mean. If the site is small then it won't matter too much with page load times, and if the site is big we'll have a build process that we can use to minify the code.</li>
						<li>Comment your code often.</li>
						<li>Stick as close to one css include and one script include per built site that you can (not including jquery or other plugins). If you break them out individually, use a minifier / compiler to stick them all into one before you push your site live.</li>
						<li>If whenever possible (like in CMS projects), break out your style and script files into componentized files, then have a build process concatenate them all into one.</li>
						<li>Always make sure your images are optimized for the web to cut down on huge page load times.</li>
						<li>Use JS and CSS linters (may we suggest SublimeLinter for Sublime Text). While they may be annoying at first, they'll help you write better code.</li>
						<li>Don't use extra, empty html elements for 'clear' fixes. In most cases you can address the situation by adding overflow: hidden; to container elements.</li>
						<li>Test your site's scrolling and animations for 'jank'. If anything appears choppy, fix it; and make sure your site runs @ 60fps.</li>
					</ul>
					<h2><a name="html">HTML files</a></h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Don't use inline styles. Critical path CSS was a thing for a little bit, but even that seems to be a thing of the past.</li>
						<li>HTML isn't complicated, so don't try to make it so. Really rethink the need for extra parent or child elements. Most of the time, one is enough (especially for things like buttons, images, etc.).</li>
						<li>Use the html5 doctype on all pages for now on.</li>
						<li>Use new text input types for now on when applicable.</li>
						<ul>
							<li>Examples:<pre>&lt;input type="email" /&gt;<br />&lt;input type="phone" /&gt;<br />&lt;input type="search" /&gt;</pre></li>
						</ul>
						<li>Most JavaScript includes no longer belong in the head. Place them at the bottom of your html, right above the ending &lt;/body&gt; tag.</li>
							<ul>
								<li>There are a few scenarios when this isn't the case however, such as when using Modernizr, HTML5 Shim, etc.</li>
							</ul>
						<li>Load all third-party scripts asynchronously. If for any reason their site isn't responding, it can block and halt the rest of your page from loading.</li>
					</ul>
					<h2><a name="css">CSS files</a></h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Whenever possible, use CSS instead of images (buttons, text over photos, etc), and if you use a lot of icons or hover states, create sprites to cut down on the number of http requests your page has to make.</li>
							<ul>
								<li>I also really like using Base64 encoding for tiny icons. This replaces the image with a long string of characters, reducing the number of http requests your page makes. I've been using <a href="http://www.base64-image.de" target="_blank">http://www.base64-image.de</a> lately.</li>
							</ul>
						<li>Write your code so it's easy to read. Then minify / compile it later for production use. This includes:</li>
						<ul>
							<li>Commenting your code often.</li>
							<li>Using extra line breaks between each style, or group of styles.</li>
							<li>Always ending each declaration with a semi-colon, even if it's the last declaration in the rule set.</li>
							<li>Using spaces after each selector, and before each value.</li>
							<li>Keeping each declaration and each selector on their own line.</li>
							<ul>
								<li>Example:
									<pre>/* main container used for content */<br />.container {<br />	color: #09c;<br />	font-size: 1.5em;<br />}</pre>
								</li>
							</ul>
						</ul>
						<li>Use shorthand whenever possible. While this may contradict my 'keep it easy to read' mantra, I find it's actually easier to read CSS if it's all on one line, so you don't have to dig around and spot others tht may be somewhere else.</li>
						<ul>
							<li>So instead of this:
								<pre>.container {<br />	background-image: url( ... );<br />	margin-top: 10px;<br />	background-color: transparent;<br />	margin-bottom: 10px;<br />}</pre>
							</li>
							<li>You'd do this:
								<pre>.container {<br />	background: transparent url( ... );<br />	margin: 10px 0;<br />}</pre>
							</li>
						</ul>
					</ul>
					<h2><a name="js">JavaScript / jQuery files</a></h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Use a namespace to keep your javascript organized and conflict-free:</li>
						<ul>
							<li>Example time.</br />So instead of this:
								<pre>var model = function () { ... };<br />var view = function () { ... };<br />var controller = function () { ... };</pre>
							</li>
							<li>You'd do this:
								<pre>var app = {<br /><br />	// accessed via 'app.model();'...<br />	model: function () { ... },<br /><br />	// accessed via 'app.view();'...<br />	view: function () { ... },<br /><br />	// accessed via 'controller.model();'...<br />	controller: function () { ... }<br /><br />};</pre>
							</li>
						</ul>
						<li>Don't style elements using javascript. Instead, add / remove classes to the elements you want to change, and style the classes in your CSS.</li>
						<li>Write your code so it's easy to read. Then minify / compile it later for production use. This includes:</li>
						<ul>
							<li>Commenting your code often.</li>
							<li>Use extra line breaks between different functions / code blocks to make everything more readable.</li>
							<li>Always ending your statements with semi-colons.</li>
							<li>Using spaces after opening, and before closing parenthesis, and after commas.</li>
							<ul>
								<li>Example:
									<pre>// when clicking a button...<br />$( '.button' ).on( 'click', function () {<br /><br />	// ...show all the awesome things!<br />	$( '.awesome' ).toggle();<br /><br />});</pre>
								</li>
							</ul>
						</ul>
						<li>When using try / catch statements, always put something in the catch. Don't leave it blank because that makes it really hard to debug when something's gone wrong.</li>
						<li>Use variable names that make sense when they're resuable. Obviously this is not needed when iterating through data, but in most other cases it should be fairly apparent what they're for.</li>
						<li>Use a linter such as JSHint to make sure your code is valid and correctly formatted. This is easily added if you use Sublime Text, just install the Sublime Linter package and make sure you change the settings from using JSLint to JSHint.</li>
					</ul>
					<h2><a name="mobile">Mobile standards</a></h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Make your site 100% funcitonal for all browser sizes.</li>
						<li>Even if you don't have a different design for different browser sizes, at least test everything and make sure it all works.</li>
						<li>When developing a site for smaller form-factors (such as phones), at a minimum use: <pre>&lt;meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width" /&gt;</pre> Most sites I work on as of late use the following, which makes sure the initial scale is the width of the mobile device: <pre>&lt;meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1" /&gt;</pre></li>
					</ul>
					<h2><a name="testing">Testing tools</a></h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Chrome Inspector is a great way to debug, test, and try tweaks to your current page without having to save / commit / compile, etc.</li>
						<li><a href="http://webpagetest.org" target="_blank">http://webpagetest.org</a> gives you a good waterfall of resources along with other analytics about page load times, etc.</li>
					</ul>
